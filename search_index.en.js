deployment phases of C/C++ applications. By harnessing the capabilities of Docker, C++ programmers can ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments, ultimately enhancing productivity and software reliability. My complete environment containing example application available as always on my github.\nPart 1 - Docker Overview\nUnderstanding Docker\nDocker is a platform that uses containerization to package and run applications in isolated environments called containers. These containers are lightweight and portable, containing everything needed to run the application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.They provide an abstraction layer between one or more processes (i.e., an application) and the OS on which they run. A container packages these processes and their underlying dependencies together so that they can be easily implemented on any OS that supports the container infrastructure. Under the hood, Docker leverages several Linux kernel features, such as cgroups (control groups) for resource isolation, namespaces for process isolation, and UnionFS (Union File System) for layering file systems.\nDocker vs Virtual Machine\n\n*Figure 1: docker vs vm - plant_uml\nFeatureContainersHypervisors\nAbstraction LayerSpecific processes and their dependenciesUnderlying hardware (virtual machines)\nRedeploymentServices and applications to multiple Linux distributions (distros)Entire systems: OS, services, applications on a single system\nSoftware IntegrationIntegrated into underlying OS and runs on hardwareManaged by hypervisor, but runs directly on hardware\nRuntime SeparationIntegrated into system during runtime, constrained by container protectionSeparated from other guests and isolated during runtime\nOperationRuns as part of OS systemRuns as separate, independent systems; protected by hypervisor\nFlexibilityContainered software can run on “bare metal” or in a hypervisor virtual machineGuest systems can use containers like on “bare metal”\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Containers and Hypervisors\nKey Components of Docker\n\n\nDocker Daemon (dockerd): This is the persistent background process running on the host machine. It listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.\n\n\nDocker Client (docker): The primary interface through which users interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker daemon using the Docker API.\n\n\nDocker Images: Immutable snapshots containing the application, its dependencies, and configurations. These images are built using Dockerfiles and stored in a local registry or a remote repository like Docker Hub.\n\n\nDocker Containers: Instances of Docker images that run as isolated processes on the host machine. Each container operates in its own isolated environment, providing security and preventing conflicts between applications and their dependencies.\n\n\nLinux Mechanisms Leveraged by Docker\n\ncgroups (Control Groups): Used for resource isolation, allowing Docker to limit and prioritize CPU, memory, disk I/O, and other resources for containers.\nNamespaces: Used for process isolation, providing each container with its own namespace for processes, network interfaces, file systems, and more.\nKey namespaces utilized by Docker include:\n\nPID Namespace: Isolates process IDs, enabling containers to maintain separate process trees.\nNET Namespace: Isolates network-related resources like interfaces and firewall rules.\nIPC Namespace: Isolates Inter-Process Communication resources.\nMNT Namespace: Manages mount points, allowing containers to have distinct filesystems.\nUTS Namespace: Isolates host and domain names, creating a unique identity for containers.\n\n\nUnionFS (Union File System): Used for layering file systems, enabling Docker to create images efficiently by layering changes on top of existing file systems.\n\nDiagrams of Docker Environment on Linux\n\nThis diagram illustrates the core components of the Docker environment on a Linux system, including the Docker daemon, containers, images, and Dockerfile used for building images.\nWhen executing Docker commands, a following sequence of interactions occurs:\n\nUnderstanding Differences between Container Technologies - Docker, LXC, and OCI\nDocker\nDocker is a platform designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of applications within containers. It abstracts application-level processes and dependencies, allowing developers to encapsulate their applications in containers that can run consistently across various environments. Docker's ecosystem includes Docker Hub for image distribution, Docker Compose for multi-container applications, and extensive APIs for automation.\nLXC (Linux Containers)\nLXC, or Linux Containers, represents a more traditional form of containerization, providing lightweight virtualization at the operating system level. It leverages Linux kernel features like cgroups (control groups) and namespaces to create isolated environments. LXC is particularly useful for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host, offering a minimalistic approach compared to Docker.\nOCI (Open Container Initiative)\nThe Open Container Initiative (OCI) was established to promote standardization within the container ecosystem. It defines open industry standards for container image formats and runtimes, ensuring interoperability across different container tools and platforms. OCI specifications are widely adopted by major container engines, including Docker, to maintain consistent container behavior.\nComparison Table: Docker, LXC, and OCI\nTo better understand the distinctions and similarities between Docker, LXC, and OCI, refer to the comparison table below:\nComparison of Docker, LXC, and OCI\nFeatureDockerLXC (Linux Containers)OCI (Open Container Initiative)\nPurposeSimplifies application deployment and managementProvides lightweight virtualization at OS levelEstablishes open industry standards for container formats and runtimes\nAbstraction LevelApplication-level with its dependenciesOS-level virtualizationStandardized framework for containers\nUsageWidely used for microservices and cloud-native applicationsUsed for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a single hostDefines container image format and runtime specifications\nIntegrationHighly integrated with Docker Hub and Docker ComposeDirectly integrates with Linux kernel featuresProvides specifications adopted by major container engines like Docker\nDeploymentEasy to deploy and manage via Docker CLI and APIsRequires more manual setup and configurationFocuses on compatibility across different container tools and platforms\nIsolationUses container technology with additional tools for managementPure container management using cgroups and namespacesEnsures consistent behavior of containers across different environments\nImage FormatDocker ImagesLXC TemplatesOCI Images\nRuntimeDocker EngineLXC ToolsOCI Runtime Specification (e.g., runc)\nCommunity and EcosystemLarge ecosystem with extensive tools and third-party integrationsMature but smaller community compared to DockerSupported by industry leaders to maintain interoperability standards\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Docker, LXC, and OCI\nSetting Up Docker for C/CPP Development\nSetting Up Docker for C/CPP Development involves installing Docker on your development machine, understanding the basics of Dockerfile for defining the development environment, and creating a Docker image tailored for C/C++ development.\nInstalling Docker on Your Development Machine\nFirst, you need to install Docker on your development machine. There are different ways to install Docker, depending on your operating system.\n\n\nDocker Desktop: Docker Desktop is a convenient solution for developers working on Windows or macOS. It includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.\nFollow the instructions provided on the Docker Desktop website to download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system.\n\n\nDocker Engine: Docker Engine is the core technology behind Docker containers. It's available for various Linux distributions and is typically installed via package managers like apt or yum.\nFollow the instructions provided on the Docker Engine website to install Docker Engine on your Linux distribution.\n\n\nBasics of Dockerfile\nCreate a new directory for your C/C++ project and navigate into it:\n\nInside your project directory, create a new file named Dockerfile using a text editor of your choice:\n\nEdit the Dockerfile and define the environment for your C/C++ project. Here's a basic example:\n\nIn this Dockerfile:\n\nFROM: Specifies the base image for the Docker image.\nENV: Sets environment variables. In this example, it disables interactive prompts during package installation.\nRUN: Executes commands within the container to install necessary tools.\nWORKDIR: Sets the working directory within the container.\nCOPY: Copies the local project files into the container.\n\nCreating a Docker Image for C/CPP Development\nOnce you've created the Dockerfile, you can build the Docker image using the docker build command. Run the following command in your project directory:\n\nThis command builds a Docker image with the tag my_cpp_image using the Dockerfile (. denotes the current directory).\nUseful Docker Client Commands\n\n\nBuilding Docker Images:\n\n\n\nRunning Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nListing Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nInspecting Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nCopying Files to/from Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nViewing Docker Logs:\n\n\n\nStopping Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nRemoving Docker Containers/Images:\n\n\n\nPulling Docker Images from Registry:\n\n\n\nPushing Docker Images to Registry:\n\n\n\nExecuting Commands inside Docker Containers:\n\n\n\nManaging Docker Networks:\n\n\n\nInspecting Docker Volumes:\n\n\n\nCleaning up Unused Resources:\n\n\n\nListing Docker Images:\n\n\n\nSearching Images Online:\n\n\n\nAttaching to a Running Container:\n\n\n\nStarting and Stopping Containers:\n\n\n\nKilling All Containers:\n\n\n\nRemoving Containers:\n\n\n\nRemoving All Containers:\n\n\n\nExporting (Saving) an Image:\n\n\n\nLoading (Importing) an Image:\n\n\n\nFinding the SHA256 Hash of a Docker Image:\n\n\n\nPulling Docker Image by the SHA256 Digest:\n\n\n\nManaging Dependencies\nManaging dependencies within your Dockerized C/C++ development environment is crucial for ensuring smooth project builds and executions. This involves:\n\nUtilizing Package Managers:\n\nUse tools like apt or yum within the Dockerfile to install system-level dependencies.\nSpecify package versions to ensure consistency and reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating Third-Party Libraries:\n\nDownload and install third-party libraries from their official sources or package repositories.\nSpecify precise versions and document dependencies for future reference.\n\n\n\n\nBy managing dependencies effectively and specifying precise versions within your Dockerfile, you ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments, making it easier to build and distribute your C/C++ projects.\nStreamlining Build Processes\nAutomating the Build Process using Dockerfile and Docker Compose\nDocker Compose can be employed for orchestrating multi-container applications and defining complex build configurations.\nLet's consider a scenario where you have a C/C++ project consisting of multiple services, such as a web server and a database. We'll compare how you would use Docker Compose and Docker run commands to manage these services.\nScenario:\nYou have a C/C++ project named \"MyProject\" that includes a web server service and a database service.\nDocker Compose Example:\nWith Docker Compose, you can define a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the deployment of multiple containers as services.\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe web_server service is defined with the my_project_web_server image, exposing port 8080 on the host and depending on the database service.\nThe database service is defined with the mysql image, setting environment variables for MySQL root password and database name.\n\nYou can then deploy the services using the following Docker Compose command:\n\nDocker Run Example:\nWith Docker run commands, you would need to manually specify each container and its configurations.\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe database container is started with the MySQL image, setting environment variables for MySQL root password and database name.\nThe web_server container is started with the my_project_web_server image, exposing port 8080 on the host and linking it to the database container.\n\nComparison:\n\nDocker Compose: Provides a declarative way to define and manage multi-container applications, simplifying service orchestration and dependencies.\nDocker Run Commands: Require manual specification of each container and its configurations, which can become cumbersome for complex applications with multiple services.\n\nIn summary, Docker Compose offers a more streamlined and maintainable approach for managing multi-container applications, while Docker run commands are suitable for simpler scenarios or quick ad-hoc deployments.\nHandling Different Build Configurations within Docker\n\nUse environment variables or build arguments in Dockerfile to handle different build configurations (e.g., Debug vs. Release).\nCustomize build commands based on the selected configuration.\n\n\nCollaboration and Deployment\nCollaboration and deployment are crucial stages in the software development lifecycle. Docker provides a robust platform for sharing development environments across teams and deploying C/C++ applications consistently in production environments. Here's how you can leverage Docker for collaboration and deployment:\nSharing Docker Images for Consistent Development Environments\n\nBuild Docker images containing your C/C++ development environment, including dependencies, libraries, and tools.\nShare these Docker images via a Docker registry or repository, ensuring consistency across development teams.\n\n\nTeam members can pull the shared Docker image to set up their development environments quickly and reliably.\nDeploying C/CPP Applications using Docker Containers in Production Environments\n\nPackage your C/C++ applications into Docker containers, along with necessary dependencies and configurations.\nDeploy these Docker containers to production environments, ensuring consistency and portability across different infrastructure setups.\n\n\nDocker containers offer isolation, scalability, and reproducibility, making them well-suited for deploying C/C++ applications in production environments.\nBy leveraging Docker for collaboration and deployment, development teams can streamline their workflows, maintain consistency across environments, and accelerate the delivery of C/C++ applications from development to production.\nBest Practices and Tips\nOptimizing Dockerfiles, managing container resources, and securing Docker containers are essential aspects of using Docker effectively for C/C++ projects. Here are some best practices and tips:\n\n\nOptimizing Dockerfiles for Efficiency:\n\nKeep Dockerfiles clean and concise by minimizing the number of layers and reducing the size of the final image.\nUse multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies, resulting in smaller images.\nUtilize caching mechanisms to speed up the build process by caching intermediate layers.\n\n\n\nManaging Container Resources Effectively:\n\nSpecify resource constraints such as CPU and memory limits for Docker containers to prevent resource contention and ensure predictable performance.\nMonitor container resource usage using Docker metrics and adjust resource limits accordingly to optimize resource utilization.\nConsider using orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale, enabling efficient resource allocation and scheduling.\n\n\n\nSecuring Docker Containers for C/CPP Projects:\n\nUpdate Docker base images and dependencies regularly to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure the security of your containers.\nImplement least privilege principles by running containers with non-root users and restricting container capabilities using Docker security features.\nEnable Docker Content Trust (DCT) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of images by verifying image signatures before pulling and running them.\nMonitor container activities and network traffic using Docker security tools and third-party solutions to detect and respond to security threats effectively.\n\n\n\nExamples:\nOptimizing Dockerfiles for Efficiency:\n\n\nMinimizing Layers:\n\n\n\nUsing Multi-Stage Builds:\n\n\n\nCaching Mechanisms:\n\n\n\nManaging Container Resources Effectively:\n\n\nSpecifying Resource Constraints:\n\n\n\nMonitoring Container Resource Usage:\n\n\n\nUsing Orchestration Tools:\n\n\n\nSecuring Docker Containers for C/CPP Projects:\n\n\nUpdating Docker Base Images:\n\n\n\nImplementing Least Privilege Principles:\n\n\n\nEnabling Docker Content Trust (DCT):\n\n\n\nMonitoring Container Activities:\n\n\n\nDebugging C/CPP Applications using GDB\nYou can use GDB's remote debugging feature to debug your C/C++ applications running inside a Docker container from a host machine. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n\nExpose GDB Server Port in Docker Container:\n\nIn your Dockerfile or Docker Compose file, expose a port for GDB server to communicate with the host machine.\n\n\n\n\nRun GDB Server in Docker Container:\n\nStart your Docker container as usual, but ensure that GDB server is running inside the container, listening on the exposed port.\n\n\n\n\nConnect Host GDB to GDB Server:\n\nOn your host machine, use the GDB command-line interface to connect to the GDB server running inside the Docker container.\n\n\n\n\nDebug C/C++ Application with Host GDB:\n\nOnce connected, you can use GDB commands on your host machine to debug the C/C++ application running inside the Docker container.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting up GDB server in the Docker container and connecting it to the host GDB, you can effectively debug your C/C++ applications running inside Docker containers from your host machine.\nDocker containers vs native builds\nThis table provides a concise comparison between Docker containers and native builds across various aspects of performance and functionality.\nAspectDocker ContainersNative Builds\nIsolation OverheadIntroduces a layer of abstraction, incurring some overhead.Executes directly on the host system without overhead.\nResource AllocationAllows fine-grained control over resource allocation.Accesses all system resources without virtualization.\nPortability and ConsistencyOffers portability across different environments, ensuring consistency.Tightly coupled to the host environment, may lack consistency.\nDependency ManagementEncapsulates dependencies within a self-contained environment.Relies on system-wide dependencies, requiring careful management.\n\nMulti Architecture Builds\nThis example demonstrates how to build a simple \"Hello, World!\" C++ application for both amd64 and arm64 architectures using Docker buildx. The resulting Docker image can be run on systems with different CPU architectures without modification, showcasing the versatility and compatibility of Docker multi-architecture builds.

Let's elaborate on its structure and functionality:\n\nMy Dockerfile sets up a comprehensive development and runtime environment tailored for C++ projects, using Debian Bookworm as the base image. It's structured into two stages: build stage and runtime stage. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's happening:\nBuild Stage\n\n\nBase Image and Metadata:\n\nStarts from debian:bookworm-slim as the base.\nSets labels for the maintainer and a description of the Docker image.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Configuration:\n\nSets DEBIAN_FRONTEND to noninteractive to avoid prompts during package installations.\nUses ARG to accept variables like USERNAME, USER_UID, USER_GID, and ARCH from the build command, setting up a flexible user environment.\nDefines HOME directory based on the USERNAME.\n\n\n\nUser Setup:\n\nCreates a non-root user with the specified UID and GID, adds them to a group, and gives them sudo access without a password. This step also performs a cleanup of the package lists.\n\n\n\nPackage Installation:\n\nInstalls a variety of packages crucial for C++ development, including build tools (like cmake, gcc, clang-15), debugging tools (gdb, valgrind), static analysis tools (cppcheck, clang-tidy), and documentation tools (doxygen).\nIt also handles installation and cleanup to keep the image size down.\n\n\n\nGEF Installation:\n\nInstalls GEF (GDB Enhanced Features), a script that supercharges the GDB debugger with additional features.\n\n\n\nPython Environment Setup:\n\nSets up a Python virtual environment and updates the PATH to use tools from this virtual environment.\n\n\n\nCodeChecker Installation:\n\nConditionally installs CodeChecker, a static analysis tool, if the architecture is AMD64. It includes installation of Node.js, compilation of CodeChecker, and linking of its binaries.\n\n\n\nProject-Specific Libraries:\n\nInstalls libraries that might be required for specific projects involving GUI, audio, or other multimedia components.\n\n\n\nRuntime Stage\n\n\nBase Image:\n\nStarts anew from debian:bookworm-slim as the base for the runtime environment.\n\n\n\nMinimal Package Installation:\n\nInstalls only the runtime libraries that are necessary for the application developed during the build stage. This includes libraries like libxrandr2, libxcursor1, etc., and excludes the development headers and tools, reducing the image size and improving security.\n\n\n\nCopy Application:\n\nCopies the compiled binaries from a presumed location (../app/build/bin) into the Docker image.\n\n\n\nCommand Specification:\n\nSets the default command to run the application using gdbserver on a specific port, allowing for remote debugging.\n\n\n\nFeatures and Usage\nBuild images and apps for different architectures\n\nRelease app build\n\n\n\nDebug app build\n\n\n\nProduction image build\n\n\nRunning the container\n\nRun Debug/Release app\n\n\n\nRun Debug/Release app under GDB server\n\n\n\nRun production container\n\n\n\nEnter the dev container\n\n\nStatic Code analysis\n\nUnit Tests\n\nMemcheck (Valgrind)\n\nScanning the image and Linting the Dockerfile\n\nProfiling\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Docker containerization offers a powerful solution for simplifying and streamlining the development, testing, and deployment of C/C++ applications. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into portable containers, Docker enables developers to create consistent and reproducible environments across different platforms.\nThroughout this guide, we've explored various aspects of Docker container management, including:\n\nSetting Up Docker for C/CPP Development, including installing Docker and creating Dockerfiles.\nConfiguring development environments within Docker containers, including installing compilers, build tools, and debugging utilities.\nManaging dependencies and incorporating third-party libraries into Docker images.\nStreamlining build processes using Dockerfile and Docker Compose.\nTesting and debugging C/C++ applications within Docker containers.\nCollaboration and deployment strategies for sharing Docker images and deploying applications in production environments.\nBest practices for optimizing Dockerfiles, managing container resources, and securing Docker containers.\n\nBy following these best practices and leveraging Docker's capabilities, C/C++ developers can enhance productivity, improve collaboration, and ensure consistency across development and production environments.

GEF makes this detective work easier and more effective, especially when you're dealing with tricky bugs or trying to understand how a program really works. Let's break down how GEF can help you and how to get started with it.\nWhat is GEF?\nGEF is a tool that adds extra powers to GDB, the GNU Debugger, which is a tool many developers use to find bugs in their programs. GEF makes GDB more user-friendly and powerful by adding new features, such as better visuals, more information about your program's status, and tools to check the security of your software.\nWhy Should You Use GEF?\nGEF makes your life easier when you're debugging:\n\nClearer Information: It shows you what's going on in your program more clearly, making it easier to understand problems.\nBetter Control: You get more ways to stop and inspect your program exactly where and when you need to.\nFind Bugs Faster: GEF has special features to help spot common mistakes that can lead to bugs.\n\nGetting Started with GEF\nSetting Up\nFirst, you need GDB installed. Then, to add GEF, you run a simple command in your terminal:\n\nThis command gets GEF set up with your GDB, and you're ready to go!\nUsing GEF\nTo start debugging a program with GEF, you open your terminal and type:\n\nThis command starts GDB like usual, but you'll notice GEF's improvements right away.\nHelpful Features\n\ncontext: This shows a snapshot of what's happening in your program, like what the computer is currently working on and what data it's handling.\nheap: If your program uses dynamic memory (allocating memory during runtime), this command helps you see how that memory is being used or misused.\npattern create / pattern search: These commands help you figure out how data is laid out in memory, which is super useful for finding certain types of bugs.\nchecksec: This command checks the security properties of your executable, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities, such as stack canaries or NX bits.\ngef config / gef save: Customize and save your GEF environment to streamline your debugging sessions, tailoring the tool to your needs.\ndereference: Offers a more intuitive view of pointers and memory addresses, making it easier to navigate through complex structures.\nregisters: Get a quick overview of the current state of CPU registers, which is crucial for low-level debugging\n\nDebugging with GEF: A Quick Example\nImagine you have a program that's not working right, and you suspect it's due to a bug where the program is trying to access memory it shouldn't. Here's how you might use GEF to find that bug:\n\nStart GEF with your program: gdb -q ./buggy_program\nSet a breakpoint: This is like telling GEF, \"Pause here; I want to check something.\" You can do this with the command break main if you want to stop right when the main function starts.\nRun the program: Just type run and hit enter. The program will start and then pause where you set the breakpoint.\nStep through the code: Use the next command to go through your program one line at a time. Watch the context information GEF gives you to see what the program is doing.\nInspect memory: If you think the bug is happening because the program is accessing memory it shouldn't, you can use commands like x/gx, heap chunks, and search-pattern to explore and manipulate memory at runtime, helping uncover issues like memory leaks or corruption.\nScripting: Automate repetitive analysis tasks or implement custom logic for complex debugging scenarios using Python scripts.\n\nThrough this process, GEF gives you a clearer view of what's happening inside your program, helping you spot and fix the bug.\nReal world example\nLet's try to use gef in action:\nI have a following code simulating buffer overflow issue:\n\nDebugging the provided C++ code with GEF (GDB Enhanced Features) will allow you to understand the execution flow, examine variables, and potentially identify vulnerabilities or logical errors. Below are steps on how to debug this C++ program using GEF, focusing on key points like setting breakpoints, stepping through the code, and inspecting the memory and variables.\nStep 1: Compile the Program with Debugging Information\nFirst, compile the C++ program (full example available:HERE): with debugging information enabled (-g) and disable optimizations (-O0) to ensure that you can inspect the source code as is during debugging.\n\nStep 2: Start and analyze GEF with the Program\n\nOpen a terminal and start GEF with your compiled program:\n\n\n\nCheck the binary security flags by checksec:\n\n\nStep 3: Set Breakpoints\nSet breakpoints at key functions to inspect their behavior. For instance, you might want to break at process_credentials to observe how input is handled and at admin_panel to see if it's possible to reach that function.\n\nStep 4: Run the Program\nStart the program within GEF by typing r or run. The program will start and stop at the first breakpoint.\n\nStep 5: After reaching breakpoint, analyze gef context command\n\nFigure 1: gef context command - more details here: https://hugsy.github.io/gef/commands/context/\nStep 6: Find the ret address of the process_credentials function\nWhen brakpoint is reached, print the address of the stack pointer which contain the return address of process_credentials function. It will be used to overrite it with admin_panel address.\n\nStep 7: Step Through the Code\nUse the next or n command to step through the code line by line. If you want to step into functions (like store_credentials_into_db), use step or s instead.\nStep 8: Inspect Variables and Memory\nAs you reach the std::cin call, you can inspect the contents of buffer and other variables:\n\nIf you want to dereference all the stack entries inside a function context (on a 64bit architecture): p ($rbp - $rsp)/8\nFind the memory address of the buffer array: p &amp;buffer[0]= 0x7fffffffd7b0\nTo examine the content of buffer: x/128c buffer\n\nStep 9: Continue Execution\nAfter inspecting the variables at the first breakpoint, continue execution to see if the second breakpoint (admin_panel) is hit.\n\nStep 10: Experiment with Inputs\nIf you're analyzing the program for vulnerabilities, you might try inputs that could potentially overflow buffer or otherwise manipulate the program's flow. Run\nStep 11: Utilize GEF Commands for Deeper Analysis\nGEF provides commands that are particularly useful for security analysis:\n\npattern create and pattern search to test for buffer overflows.\nheap bins to inspect the heap state if dynamic memory allocation is used elsewhere in the program.\n\nStep 12: Quit GEF\nOnce you're done debugging, you can quit GEF with the quit command.\nMore commands\nAll the available GEF commands available here.\nBonus\nI've also developed an exploit for the provided code using insights from gef. You can locate it here. Please remember to customize the addresses, specifically process_credentials_ret_addr and buffer_addr, to match those on your system.\"\nConclusion\nGEF is like a supercharged version of GDB that makes debugging less of a headache. It's packed with features that give you a clearer view of your program and help you find and fix bugs more efficiently. Whether you're a new developer or have been coding for years, GEF is a valuable tool to add to your software debugging toolkit.\nHappy hacking!\n","id":"https://luk6xff.github.io/posts/gef-tool/","title":"GEF - A better GDB"},"https://luk6xff.github.io/posts/led-clock/":{"body":"A Supercharged LED Clock\nToday, we're diving into one of my latest small projects that's perfect for anyone who loves building and coding.
